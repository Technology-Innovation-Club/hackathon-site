**About The Tech Innovation Club**

The Tech Innovation Club (TIC) provides a platform for tech-savvy members of the Pan-Atlantic University (PAU) community, to create technological solutions that will add value to the PAU community and society. The club achieves this mission by fostering collaboration on projects, building software, organizing hackathons and supporting each member’s innovative interests. The club aims to provide students with opportunites to develop real world solutions to problems and provide them with support to scale these solutions beyond the university community.

Founded in 2022, the club has quickly established itself as a leading tech community of 50+ members. It is a student-run club in PAU and has hosted two events that gave students the opportunity to build real world projects. They are the TIC Hackathon 2024 and the CodeSpark Competition and Tech Fair 2025. These competitions directly led about 80 participants to build real world projects last session. They also resulted in a currently ongoing partnership with the school administration to further develop three of the projects built during the session for schoolwide use.

In addition, three participants of these competitions are currently in various stages of launching their own startups while three of the club’s founding members have gone on to jobs at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank representing the club’s world class talent.

Beyond competitions, TIC remains committed to shaping the next generation of tech leaders through impactful projects, skill-building initiatives, and a thriving community of innovators dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology.

**Description and Theme of the Hackathon**

The TIC Hackathon 2.0 is a 24-hour innovation challenge that brings together Pan-Atlantic University students to collaborate, build, and pitch solutions to real-world problems using technology. The theme of the Hackathon is **Reimagining Today with AI.** Participants are expected to design solutions that leverage AI in diverse fields such as education, fintech, productivity, and much more.

We are also exploring the possibility of getting support to enable the top 3 winners launch their solutions as startups.

**Format Of the Hackathon**

The hackathon is a 24- hour innovation challenge and will consist of 80 participants grouped in teams. Each team will develop a solution that showcases an application of Artificial Intelligence to solve practical problems. Membership of those teams is exclusive to students of Pan-Atlantic University for this edition.

**Rules of the hackathon**

*   Each team must be composed of a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 members.
*   Each team’s solution must utilise Artificial Intelligence technology to solve a practical problem.
*   Each team will have 8 minutes to pitch their idea to a panel of judges (4 minutes for pitching and 4 minutes for answering questions from the judges).
*   Pitching is 1 hour 40 minutes

#### **Grading Criteria**

Participants projects will be judged based on the following criteria namely:

*   **Originality** – Uniqueness and creativity of the project idea. Clarity of identified problem and implemented solution **(10 marks)**
*   **Viability** – Feasibility and real-world applicability of project. This is for an explanation of how their projects will be applied in the real world. Each project should have a clear potential for real world use.
*   **Scalability** – Potential for growth and significant improvement of the project. **(10 marks)**
*   **Functionality** – Project features and effectiveness of the proposed solution for tackling the identified problem. Grading should be based on the product features that participants have implemented and those they aim to implement. **(10 marks)**
*   **Teamwork** – Collaboration and synergy within the team. Teams should have a team slide where each member’s roles are stated clearly. Their ability to effectively balance both the MVP demo and pitching, including their handling of Q&A questions as a team, should be graded. **(10 marks)**
*   **Presentation** – Clarity, engagement, and persuasiveness of the pitch. Ability to conduct a live demo of the MVP should be rewarded with more marks in this criterion. **(10 marks)**

Note: Each team is expected to demo an MVP of their solution. As such, they will be penalised for failure to do so.

**Total marks available = 60 marks**
